    "The error message indicates that the request was made to an invalid or non-existent endpoint. The API responded with a 400 Bad Request error, meaning the request is not correctly formatted or does not match an available resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The description provides a list of valid endpoints, such as `apikeys`, `config`, `experiments`, `users`, etc. This suggests that the issue is likely due to a typo in the endpoint name or an incorrect URL structure. To resolve this, on the next step we will use one of the listed endpoints in the request.\n",
